# Advent of code 2023

## Set user input
Each day has an input folder with 2 files `sample-input.txt` and `input.txt`. `sample-input.txt` is the input which is used to explain the problem, `input.txt` is the input user specific input for that day.

## How to run
For help run:
```bash
$ cargo run -- --help
```
by default `cargo run` will run the part 1 with sample input

to run part 2 for day 1 use:
```bash
$ cargo run -- --part2 --day 1
```

to run with user specific input for day 12:
```bash
$ cargo run -- --my-input --day 12
```
